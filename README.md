Stack: Express, Sequilize => MySSQL, Babel, React, Bootstrap, Docker.

Some assumptions and simplications were made:
* No time for perfect separation
* No time for perfect comment - instead simple and clean naming to keep code readable
* It's just easier to install node modules separatly for now.
* Docker compose config is simplified as well.
